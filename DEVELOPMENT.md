# Development Notes

## Important: Do Not Run After Changes

**NEVER run the application or build commands after making code changes.**

The developer will run the application locally in their own environment.

### What Not To Do:
- ❌ `npm start`
- ❌ `npm run build`
- ❌ `./build.sh`
- ❌ `go build`
- ❌ `./singleton-sort`

### What To Do:
- ✅ Make code changes
- ✅ Edit files
- ✅ Answer questions about the code
- ✅ Provide explanations
- ✅ Show what was changed

The developer handles all running, building, and testing locally.
